# Markov Weather Chain

This script is a markov weather chain to predict the chance of a weather type (sunny or rainy) after a few days,
given an initial condition of sunny and a probability matrix of it being sunny or rainy one day and then sunny
or rainy the next.  Uses C++ Eigen library, which is really helpful for working with matrices.
